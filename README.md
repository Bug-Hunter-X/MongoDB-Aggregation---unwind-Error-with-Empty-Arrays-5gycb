# MongoDB Aggregation: Handling Empty Arrays in $unwind

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: using the `$unwind` operator on an array field that might be empty.  The example uses a `users` collection and a `products` collection to illustrate the issue and its solution.

## Problem

The `$unwind` stage in the aggregation pipeline is used to deconstruct an array field, creating a separate document for each element in the array.  However, if the array is empty, the `$unwind` stage will throw an error.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code that demonstrates this error.

## Solution

The solution involves adding a `$match` stage before the `$unwind` stage to filter out documents with empty `productIds` arrays. This ensures that the `$unwind` stage only operates on documents with non-empty arrays, preventing errors.

The `bugSolution.js` file contains the corrected code that addresses this issue.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running.
3. Run the `bug.js` (to see the error) and `bugSolution.js` (to see the solution) scripts.
